#### Directions

## Homework 8: Textures for Data Storage
Create a program using GLSL that uses textures for data storage.

This is a free form assignment.  You can use textures to store functional
relations, translations, noise, bump maps, or any similar application.

What to submit:

1) README with discussion of results, brief instructions on how to use the
program and a short discussion of what specific application you are using the
texture(s) for;

2) One ZIP or TAR archive containing all files you are submitting;

3) Source code (shader and prorgam), Makefile and any data files I need;

4) Time it took you to complete the assignment.


#### Program Use Instructions

My solution is based on ex17. The texture is initialized with an image and saved in CPU, and shader is using the texture to draw the surface of the lamp I created. 
And I aslo added mixed the image texture with some others. The textures are following this link: https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise/blob/master/demo/common/noisedemoMain.frag.

**Time To Complete Assignment:** 10 hours
