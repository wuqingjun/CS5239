Advanced Shaders

CSCI 5239 Fall 2016

#### Directions

## Homework 9: Advanced Shaders 

For this assignment you can implement a particle engine or an advanced shader
such as a geometry or tessalation shader.


If you choose to implement a particle engine, you can do small or large
particles.  For large particles point sprites may be desirable.


Alternatively, you can create a program that uses one of the newer shader types
such as a geometry, tesselation or compute shader.


What to draw is up to you.  Choose something that illustrates the techniques you
are implementing.


What to submit:


1) README with brief instructions on how to use the program and what I should take note of;


2) One ZIP or TAR archive containing all files you are submitting;


3) Source code (shader and prorgam), Makefile and any data files I need;


4) Time it took you to complete the assignment.

#### Program Use Instructions

The solution is based on ex19. I am drawing snow and smoke in this solution. My machines don't support GLSL 3/4 and I cannot apply geometry shaders.

**Time To Complete Assignment:** 3 hours
