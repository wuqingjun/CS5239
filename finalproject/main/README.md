#### Features

In the final project, the scenary I am drawing includes characters of Disney Frozen: Princess Elsa, snowman Olaf. Princess Elsa has the magic 
to make the snow, and can change its direction and size, she can also change the look of Olaf and especially melt it into flowing water.


#### Program Use Instructions
Please use FireFox to open the main.html.

There's a control panel in the right corner of the page, you can use it change size of snow, camera position and etc. 


##### What is copied and what is my contribution to the project

The 3D objects are dowloaded from internet; the noise functions for snow and smoke are also copied from internet, but I applied it into making snow, and also make the smoke moving along a sin/cos curve and make it interesting. 

The original code of melting snowman olaf is based on a WebGL tutorial in Youtube, which original shows a ring with rotating textures, I applied this pattern to Olaf.

The firework is following a regulare Javascript implementation,I changed it to use Shader.
