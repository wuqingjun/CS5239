Performance
Qingjun Wu
CSCI 5239 Spring 2016

#### Directions
Investigate the performance of different elements of GLSL.  Examples of things
you may investigate is float vs. int, performance of constructs like if,
select, builtin functions vs. explicit calculation, the cost of transcendental
functions, inline code vs. function calls, performance differences between
different video cards or operating systems, etc.


What the program should do is left to your imagination.  The scene could
involve lighting, textures, and similar features, but the assignment is to
investigate performance of different ways of doing things.


You will need to implement a frame counter to measure the number of frames
per second to evaluate performance.    Make sure you disable VSYNC so that you
measures the true frame rate.


#### Program Use Instructions


Use the Quit button or the window's exit button to end the program.

**Time To Complete Assignment:** ~ hours

Based on provided class Example 4.
